### Installation

#### Automatic installation

Automatic installation is the easiest way -- WordPress will handle the file transfer, and you won’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of the plugin:

- Log in to your WordPress dashboard
- Navigate to the Plugins menu, and click "Add New"
- In the search field type "wptelegram" and hit Enter
- Locate the plugin in the list of search results
- Click on "Install Now" and wait for the installation to complete
- Click on "Activate"

#### Manual installation

Manual installation method requires downloading the plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The official WordPress documentation contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#manual-plugin-installation).

#### Updating

Automatic updates should work smoothly, but we still recommend you back up your site.
